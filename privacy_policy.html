        <h2>2. Non-Personal Identification Information</h2>
        <p>We may collect non-personal identification information about Users whenever they interact with our App. Non-personal identification information may include the device name, the type of device and technical information about Users' means of connection to our App, such as the operating system, the Internet service providers utilized, and other similar information. This data helps us understand how our users, as a group, use the services and resources provided in our App.</p>
        <p>Examples of non-personal data include usage statistics, crash reports, and anonymous analytics. This information is used to improve the performance and stability of the App, as well as to enhance the user experience. This information is not linked to any specific individual.</p>

        <p>While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.

        <h2>6. Third-Party Websites</h2>
        <p>Users may find advertising or other content on our App that links to the sites and services of our partners, suppliers, advertisers, sponsors, licensors, and other third parties. We do not control the content or links that appear on these sites and are not responsible for the practices employed by websites linked to or from our App. In addition, these sites or services, including their content and links, may be constantly changing. These sites and services may have their own privacy policies and terms of service. Browsing and interaction on any other website, including websites which have a link to our App, is subject to that website's own terms and policies.</p>
