If you do not agree to all of these Terms, do not use the App. We may update these Terms from time to time, and your continued use of the App after any such changes constitutes your acceptance of the new Terms.</p>

        <h2>1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
        <p>By accessing or using the App, you signify your agreement to these Terms and our Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to these Terms, you may not access or use the App. We reserve the right to modify these Terms at any time without prior notice. Your continued use of the App after such changes have been posted constitutes your acceptance of the revised Terms.</p>

        <h2>2. Use of the App</h2>
        <p>The App is provided for your personal, non-commercial use only. You agree not to use the App for any illegal or unauthorized purpose. You must not, in the use of the App, violate any laws in your jurisdiction, including but not limited to copyright laws.

Our trademarks and trade dress may not be used in connection with any product or service without the prior written consent of Flirt Pro.</p>

        <h2>4. User Content and Conduct</h2>
        <p>The App allows you to use content generated by the AI. You are responsible for any content you use and share. You agree not to post, use, or transmit any content that is offensive, unlawful, defamatory, libelous, harassing, or infringes on the rights of others. You agree that your content will not contain viruses or other malicious code. Flirt Pro reserves the right to remove any content for any reason without prior notice.</p>
        <p>You agree to use the App in a manner that is consistent with all applicable laws and regulations. You shall not engage in any conduct that restricts or inhibits any other user from using or enjoying the App. You shall not use the App to impersonate any person or entity, or falsely state or otherwise misrepresent your affiliation with a person or entity.</p>

            <li>Use any automated system, including without limitation "robots," "spiders," or "offline readers," to access the App in a manner that sends more request messages to our servers than a human can reasonably produce in the same period by using a conventional web browser.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>6. Termination</h2>
        <p>We may terminate or suspend your account and access to the App immediately, without prior notice or liability, for any reason whatsoever, including, without limitation, if you breach the Terms. Upon termination, your right to use the App will immediately cease. If you wish to terminate your account, you may simply discontinue using the App. All provisions of the Terms which by their nature should survive termination shall survive termination, including, without limitation, ownership provisions, warranty disclaimers, indemnity, and limitations of liability.</p>

        <h2>9. Governing Law</h2>
        <p>These Terms shall be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of Kenya, without regard to its conflict of law provisions. Any dispute arising out of or in connection with these Terms shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of Kenya.</p>

        <h2>10. Severability</h2>
        <p>If any provision of these Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable by a court, the remaining provisions of these Terms will remain in effect. These Terms constitute the entire agreement between us regarding our App, and supersede and replace any prior agreements we might have had between us regarding the App.</p>
